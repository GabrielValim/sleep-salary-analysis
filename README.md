# 😴 The More You Sleep, The More You Earn?

> A data-driven investigation (with a dash of insomnia)

Does a good night’s sleep affect how much you earn?  
In this project, we explore that hypothesis using **data science**, applying linear regression to understand the relationship between sleep, productivity, stress, and monthly income across different professions.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To explore — with a touch of humor and technical accuracy — the question:

> **“Does sleeping more help you earn more?”**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧼 Handling missing values and outliers
- 📈 Simple and multiple linear regression with `statsmodels`
- 📊 Visualizations with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- 📐 Interpretation of regression coefficients and statistical significance

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- There’s a **strong correlation between sleep and productivity** (r ≈ 0.9)
- **Productivity strongly influences salary**
- When controlling for other variables, **sleep loses its direct impact**
- **Profession** is the most decisive factor for income (devs and engineers lead the chart)

---

## 🔬 Conclusion

Sleeping more won’t directly boost your paycheck...  
But it **makes you more productive**.  
And productivity — well, that **pays off**.

📌 The multiple regression showed that salary is mostly influenced by:
- 💼 Profession
- 📈 Productivity
- (and yes — a bit of sleep too)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Collect real-world data via surveys or APIs (e.g. Google Fit)
- Test more robust models (like Ridge, Lasso, or XGBoost)
- Explore other behavioral hypotheses with synthetic data
